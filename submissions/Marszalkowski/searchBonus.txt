For my mySearches.py map, I chose to create a simplified map of Erie County, New York,
which contains my hometown of Buffalo.
The way that the goal route is currently structured:
(1) The instances run without exception and produce valid outputs.
(2) BFS finds a much less costly route than DFS and
(3) UCS finds a better route than BFS
