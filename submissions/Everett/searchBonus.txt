+10 - An instance that yields a better solution with UCS than BFS (Madison)

35 - The problem runs without exceptions*, and generates valid output for, all four searches.

+10: Show that the state space of the problem contains at least 50 states (Labyrinth)

The maze instance is just shy of the 50 states; however, the due to the size of the Labyrinth, it exceeds
50 states within the problem.

+10: An instance that yields a better solution with BFS than DFS (maze instance)
******
Since there is only one solution for the maze, every search algorithm would have the exact same cost.
Because of this, I based the search solution's success off of how many moves did it take
for the search algorithm to reach the goal. In this case, BFS finds the goal in 18 moves, compared to
DFS finding it in 18 moves.

+10: An instance that yields a better solution with UCS than BFS (maze instance)

For the maze, UCS reaches the goal in 15 moves compared to BFS, which reached the goal in 18 moves.

+10: UCS finds a solution at least 1 move deep.
+10: UCS finds a solution at least 2 moves deep.
+10: UCS finds a solution at least 4 moves deep.

For both of my maze and labyrinth, the results of UCS exceeds 4 moves due to the complexity of the problems.
