-This data set is of wine recognition data gathered by the results of a chemical analysis of three different wines
grown in Italy.


WineClasses[2]: --- First K
Silhouette Coefficient: 0.472398
Calinski-Harabaz Index: 118.603282

WineClasses[110]: --- Middle K
Silhouette Coefficient: 0.231907
Calinski-Harabaz Index: 702.110079


WineClasses[111]: --- Last K
Silhouette Coefficient: 0.213605
Calinski-Harabaz Index: 679.046480


On some occasions, the middle K maximizes the Calinski-Harabaz Index. 

(5) Submit a project at C level by Saturday, Dec. 1 before 6:00 am.
     I did it!



(10) Apply Principal Component Analysis to reduce a data set with more than
3 columns, to one with 3 columns.

     I used the sklearn module to complete this task.


(5) Normalize your data, so that every value 0 <= data[i][j] <= 1.
